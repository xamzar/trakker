# trakker
An app that can assist the process of tracking your workouts and visualize progress.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
2. Start a simple static server in the project root (for example, `python -m http.server 8000`).
3. Open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your browser.
4. Log sets with exercise name, weight, reps, and perceived effort (RPE).
5. The app calculates multiple 1RM estimates (Epley, Brzycki, Lombardi) and graphs 1RM progression per exercise over time.
6. Notes and perceived ease are saved with each set to review alongside the trend line.
